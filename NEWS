Version 1.0.1 [2018-04-17]
--------------------------

* Fix issues when Nextcloud's Music app is used as Ampache server.

  Fix crash if server ignores 'limit' parameter and sends more data than it was requested.

  Fix crash when server returns empty album art URL for not available album arts.

  Fix crash when album art URL can not be parsed.

* Ensure the loading error status message is not overwritten.

  If error occures during loading an error message is shown in status line.  Sometimes happened that this message
  was later overwritten by "Loaded" message when loading finished.  This is now fixed so that the error message always
  stays displayed after loading has finished.



Version 1.0.0 [2017-07-26]
--------------------------

* Disable single-click activation of items.

  On some platforms single-click on artist, album or track item resulted to its activation and thus to the 'play'
  action.  With such behavior it is problematic or impossible to select multiple items before trggering 'play' or
  to browse items without activating them.  This behavior is now overriden and items are activated by double-click
  on all platforms.
