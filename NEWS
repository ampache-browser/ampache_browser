Ampache Browser User Visible Changes
====================================


Version 1.0.7 [20??-??-??]
--------------------------

* Fix infite 'Loading...' state.

  If Ampache declares higher number of Albums than really available (for example, when it groups multi-disk
  albums to a single albums) then 'Loading...' state never finished in Ampache Browser.  This is now fixed.

* Fix sorting of tracks on albums with multiple disks.

  Since version 6 Ampache started to serve multiple disk albums as one album instead of each disk separately.  Ampache
  Browser ordered tracks by track number regardless of the disk number.  This lead to wrong ordering if tracks were
  numbered on each disk from "1".  The track order in such case was:

  1. track 1 (from disk 1)
  2. track 1 (from disk 2)
  ...

  After the fix the order is correct:

  1. track 1 (from disk 1)
  2. track 2 (from disk 1)
  ...

* Required API version was increased to 440001.

  Ampache Browser now uses Ampache API 440001 instead of 350001.  This is because of previous fix of tracks sorting
  as the older APIs does not contain information about disk number.



Version 1.0.6 [2023-09-01]
--------------------------

* Do not autodetect Qt version during build.

  Introduces build option USE_QT6 for controlling whether Ampache Browser should be build with Qt 6 or Qt 5.
  Previous behavior was to autodetect whether Qt6 is installed and use it if yes, otherwse use Qt5.

  It also fixes build failures in case both Qt 6 and Qt 5 were present but some of the required Qt 6 modules were
  missing.

  Default value of USE_QT6 is ON.



Version 1.0.5 [2023-02-22]
--------------------------

* Add compatibilty with Qt 6.



Version 1.0.4 [2022-07-25]
--------------------------

* Fix One Definition Rule violation (-Wodr) when building with -flto.



Version 1.0.3 [2020-10-02]
--------------------------

* Fix building with gcc 10.



Version 1.0.2 [2018-10-25]
--------------------------

* Fix random crashes during loading of album arts in some environments.



Version 1.0.1 [2018-04-17]
--------------------------

* Fix issues when Nextcloud's Music app is used as Ampache server.

  Fix crash if server ignores 'limit' parameter and sends more data than it was requested.

  Fix crash when server returns empty album art URL for not available album arts.

  Fix crash when album art URL can not be parsed.

* Ensure the loading error status message is not overwritten.

  If error occures during loading an error message is shown in status line.  Sometimes happened that this message
  was later overwritten by "Loaded" message when loading finished.  This is now fixed so that the error message always
  stays displayed after loading has finished.



Version 1.0.0 [2017-07-26]
--------------------------

* Disable single-click activation of items.

  On some platforms single-click on artist, album or track item resulted to its activation and thus to the 'play'
  action.  With such behavior it is problematic or impossible to select multiple items before trggering 'play' or
  to browse items without activating them.  This behavior is now overriden and items are activated by double-click
  on all platforms.

--------------------------

* [Windows] Fixed data loading from cache.

  Data loaded from cache were incomplete.  Only some artists/albums/tracks were loaded.

--------------------------

* Added support for MS Windows platform.
