Ampache Browser User Visible Changes
====================================


Version 1.0.0 [2017-07-26]
--------------------------

* Disable single-click activation of items.

  On some platforms single-click on artist, album or track item resulted to its activation and thus to the 'play'
  action.  With such behavior it is problematic or impossible to select multiple items before trggering 'play' or
  to browse items without activating them.  This behavior is now overriden and items are activated by double-click
  on all platforms.
